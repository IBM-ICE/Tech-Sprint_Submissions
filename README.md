# Tech-Sprint_Submissions
Central repository for Tech Sprint 2024 Entries. Teams will submit their solutions, working video demonstrations, and project documentation.

## Submission Guidelines
1. Create a folder named after your team in the root directory (e.g., `/TeamAlpha`).
   - `/Code` for your source code
   - `/Video` for your working demo video
   - `/PPT` for your presentation
   - `/LLD` for your low-level design document
3. Once your folder is ready, submit your work via a pull request. See the following methods given below for your Submissions.

## Instructions to Teams
1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-ice/TechSprint_Submissions.git
```

2. Create a New Branch:

Each team should create their branch using the following command:

Replace [teamname] with the actual team name (e.g., team-alpha-submission).
